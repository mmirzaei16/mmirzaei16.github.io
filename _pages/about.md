Hello there! I’m mohammad, a mechatronic engineer with more than 2.5 years professional experience 
Also a new ROS & python developer.  I’m profoundly passionate about robotic engineering and right now my interest fields contain control, ROS programming & gazebo simulation & image processing and I strongly believe in approach of design and development so because of that, I’ve worked on a range of projects from industrial design, electrical circuit design & simulation. intricacy aside, I love playing SETAR ( an Iranian traditional music instrument ) and Mountaineering . To communicate with me you can ping on social media and shoot me an email.
