Hello there! I’m Mohammad, a mechatronic engineer with more than 3 years of professional experience Also, a new ROS & python developer.  I’m profoundly passionate about robotics engineering and right now my interest fields contain control, ROS programming & gazebo simulation & image processing and I strongly believe in the approach of design and development so because of that, I’ve worked on a range of projects from industrial design, electrical circuit design & simulation. Intricacy aside, I love playing SETAR (an Iranian traditional music instrument) and Mountaineering. To communicate with me you can ping on social media and shoot me an email.
