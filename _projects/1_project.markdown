<h3>About</h3>
<br>
<p align="justify">
A biomedical robot with a 4DOF arm and 2 DOF gripper could move the sampler (A device for laboratory sampling) and with a number recognition process could fill & empty specific fluid volume of the sampler to performing medical laboratory tests.
As a head designer, my responsibilities involved Designing & manufacturing & some control works.
</p>

In the following, I’m going to describe some sections of my duties and expressing how this robot works.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Mechanical analysis & design & manufacturing</h3>
<br>
This robot consists of two major sections which will be described:
<h4>1) Base body</h4> 
<br>
<p align="justify">
After approximately 3 primary designs we could reach our purpose, that’s looking at an alien’s object.
The shaped surface of the robot with help of my friend was designed by REVIT software and then because of manufacturing and assembling, that’s thickened by Solid works software. The manufacturing process was 3D printing with polishing & painting.

<h4>2) A 4 DOF Arm with 2 DOF Gripper</h4>
<br>
<p align="justify">
The arm consists of 3 revolute joints & 1 prismatic joint , which revolute joints are operating with dynamixel motors with AL link structure, and the prismatic joint works with step motor with ball screw , wagon & rail to obtain an strong accurate mechanism without vibration.

Several important simulations by ANSYS can also be seen.

Another duty that I had done were extracting forward and inverse kinematic equations.

The mainboard with an STM 32 microcontroller was designed to perform movements & a UP board is considered for image processing and communication with an android application to set up a robot.
