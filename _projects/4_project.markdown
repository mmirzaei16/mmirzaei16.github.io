About
It’s the most complicated simulation which I have ever done, a composite wing that designed by ANSYS ACP & Solid Works then simulated by coupling of ANSYS Fluent and transient structural analysis because of impact under of wing by the wind.
It will be described in more detail below:

The purpose of this analysis is the simulation of the most destructive position of the plane's wing model with a specific airfoil section and that would be an impact when a plane is landing.
First of all the wing and air domains were designed by solid works then layers of the composite were set up by ANSYS ACP software.

Simulation was performed By ANSYS fluent and transient structural.
